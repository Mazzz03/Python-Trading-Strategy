# Python-Trading-Strategy
This repository contains my notebooks and dataset for a trading strategy that I created and backtested with Python. The main objective for this project was to impove my Python data science skills and to improve mu understanding of algorithmic trading. The 'getting SP500 price data.ipynb' file contains the code that I used to gather the reuired data. The 'SP500_Prices2013till2019.csv' file is all the required data saved in a csv file. The 'Trading strategy with explanation .ipynb' file contains the code for creating and backtesting my trading strategy. Both notebooks are supported with text explaining my code and thought process. I want to thank you for taking the time to view my work, any comments or suggestions for improvement are appreciated.
